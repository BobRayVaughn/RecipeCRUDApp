# RecipeCRUDApp
This app was created for the Thinkful Software Engineering Immersive program.
A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update or delete selected data. For this project, you will build the interface of a food recipe CRUD app. The interface won't use a database or an API to store the data; it will require you to use React's useState() hook.
In this project, you will build a Recipe tracking app. The app will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button. You will also be asked to add styling as provided in the mockup.
